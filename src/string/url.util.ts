/**
 * Parses `location.search` string (e.g `?a=1&b=2`) into a StringMap, e.g:
 * `{ a: '1', b: '2' }`
 *
 * Pass `location.search` to it in the Frontend, or any other string on the Backend (where `location.search` is not available).
 *
 * Works both with and without leading `?` character.
 *
 * Yes, there's `URLSearchParams` existing in the Frontend (not in Node yet), but it's API is not
 * as convenient. And the implementation here is super-small.
 *
 * Goal of this function is to produce exactly same output as URLSearchParams would.
